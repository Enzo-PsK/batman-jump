## Batman Jump

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to see Batman walking peacefully through the Mario World? In this game you can see it happening :) \

## About

Hello there! This project was done by me on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, it's not a copy or clone from anywhere. I hope everyone enjoys the game and also retrieve some knowledge from this code.\
Project Stack: NextJS + Typescript + SCSS

## Roadmap
- ~~Local leaderboard (best score)~~
- Dynamic obstacles (more difficult over the game)
- Create a secure way to set the score for anti-cheat purposes
- Online leaderboard
- Improve hitbox collision math and size on mobile
- Improve animation flow


## Running locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
