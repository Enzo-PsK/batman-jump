## Batman Jump

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to see Batman walking peacefully through the Mario World? In this game you can see it happening :)

## About

Hello there! This project was done by me on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, it's not a copy or clone from anywhere. I hope everyone enjoys the game and also retrieve some knowledge from this code.
Project Stack: NextJS + Typescript

## Roadmap
- Fix hitbox collision on mobile
- Local leaderboard
- Online leaderboard
- Create a secure way to set the score for anti-cheat purposes
- Dynamic obstacles (more difficult over the game)
- Improve animation flow
- Improve hitbox collision math


## Running locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
